# üóÇÔ∏è Yasashii Anki

I wanted an easier way to create anki flashcards without needing to manually input them myself, a long and exhausting task. 

I created AutoAnkiMaker to create a whole bunch of Anki flashcards from just a list of Japanese words. It finds the definitions and adds them to Anki automatically for you. 

## How to Use

- Download jmdict
- Create Anki deck with fields
- Fill out .env from .env.example
- `uv tool install . -e`
