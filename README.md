# üóÇÔ∏è auto-anki-maker

I wanted an easier way to create anki flashcards without needing to manually input them myself, a long and exhausting task. 

I created AutoAnkiMaker to create a whole bunch of Anki flashcards from just a list of Japanese words. It finds the definitions and adds them to Anki automatically for you.
